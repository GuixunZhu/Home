abstract = {Abstract In this paper, an integrated smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model for complex interfacial flows with large density ratios is developed. The discrete continuity equation and acceleration equation are obtained by considering the time derivative of the volume of particle and Eckart's continuum Lagrangian equation. A continuum surface force model is used to meet the fact that surface force may not be distributed uniformly on each side of the interface. An improved boundary condition is imposed to model wall free-slip and no-slip condition for interfacial flows with large density ratios. Particle shifting algorithm (PSA) is added for interfacial flows by imposing the normal correction near the interface, called as Interface-PSA. Then four representative numerical examples, including droplet deformation, Rayleigh-Taylor instability, dam breaking, and bubble rising, are presented and compared well with reference data. It is demonstrated that inherent interfacial flow physics can be well captured, including surface tension and the dynamic evolution of the complex interfaces.},
